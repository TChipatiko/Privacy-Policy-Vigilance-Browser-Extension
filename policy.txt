Privacy Policy â€“ Vigilance Browser Extension

Effective Date: [Insert today's date]

Vigilance is a browser extension designed to assist cybersecurity professionals in investigating IP addresses and file hashes across multiple threat intelligence platforms.

1. Data Collection
Vigilance does not collect, store, or transmit any personal, sensitive, or identifiable user data. All actions performed by the extension are initiated manually by the user and are limited to opening threat intelligence websites based on selected text (e.g., IP or hash).

2. Data Usage
Since no data is collected, there is no use of personal data by this extension.

3. Data Sharing
This extension does not share any user data with third parties.

4. Third-Party Services
When users initiate searches, queries are sent to external threat intelligence platforms (e.g., VirusTotal, OTX, IBM X-Force) which may log requests according to their own privacy policies. Vigilance does not control or monitor these services.

5. Changes to This Policy
Any updates to this privacy policy will be published at the same URL and take effect immediately.
